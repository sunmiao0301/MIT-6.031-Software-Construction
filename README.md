## 6.031: Software Construction

http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/

### Objectives

The prime objective of 6.031 is learning how to write code that is:

- safe from bugs (SFB),
- easy to understand (ETU), and
- ready for change (RFC).

Every idea and skill in the course is calibrated against those goals. Specific objectives include:

- an understanding of key software engineering ideas, including interfaces, representation independence, specifications, invariants, abstract data types, design patterns, and unit testing
- the ability to apply these ideas to design, implement, and test a small- to medium-scale software system (up to a few thousand lines of code, multiple modules), by:
  - defining abstract data types
  - writing specifications for operations
  - choosing concrete representations and defining abstraction functions and representation invariants
  - writing a comprehensive suite of unit tests
  - creating regular expressions and grammars for parsing input
  - creating client-server programs that adhere to a given protocol
  - designing a concurrent program using concurrent language features and library types
  
- an understanding of general programming-language concepts such as static typing, exceptions, access control, interfaces, and equality, and ability to use Java as a particular example language with those concepts
- the ability to use modern programming tools (e.g. Eclipse, Git, JUnit) and modern programming technologies (e.g. I/O, regular expressions, network sockets, threads, GUIs)
- experience working in a project team

## Classwork Grading and Makeup

http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/general/classwork-grading.html


Each class meeting has a classwork grade out of 10 points, which combines:

- exercises before class (reading questions, Java Tutor, GitStream)

- a nanoquiz at the start of class

- exercises during class (programming, clicker questions, other activities)

All classwork results are found on Omnivore (see link on the [course homepage](http://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/sp21/)). This includes both before-class work (reading exercises, Java Tutor, GitStream) and in-class work (nanoquizzes, clicker questions, in-class programming). Some results need more time than others to reach Omnivore, so if you donâ€™t see something immediately, please be patient.
